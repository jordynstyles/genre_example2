                <div class="post-meta">April 7, 2025 • Written by Jordyn Styles • Festival Recap</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="post-content">
                <p>This month, the Lyric Theater in Blacksburg, Virginia hosted its second annual International Film Festival. In the last year or so, I’ve tried to make an effort to watch more international cinema. I often think about the year South Korean director Bong Joon Ho won the Academy Award for best picture for his film Parasite. During his speech, he said “Once you overcome the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” And he was right. Some of the best movies I’ve seen, including his, are foreign. And there’s still so many more I’ve yet to see. </p>
                
                <p>I wasn’t able to attend the Lyric’s film festival last year, so I jumped on the opportunity to participate when I saw the event would be happening again. Spanning three evenings, in the first week of April, the Lyric chose to recognize films from Brazil, Spain, and China, and I saw each one.</p>
                
                <h2>Day 1: Brazil </h2>
                
                <div class="film-card">
                    <img src="City of God.jpg" alt="City of God poster" class="film-card-image">
                    <div class="film-card-content">
                        <h3 class="film-card-title">City of God</h3>
                        <div class="film-card-director">Directors: Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund</div>
                        <p> <i>City of God</i> <i>(Cidade de Deus)</i> is a Brazilian film following a group of young children growing up in poverty-stricken Rio de Janeiro between 1960 and 1980. Despite exploring a topic that is often upsetting, there’s a certain levity to this film I found quite refreshing. I was immediately reminded of Sean Baker’s <i>The Florida Project</i>, which is able to mask much of its distressing subject matter because the story is being told from the perspective of a child. A similar thing is happening in this film as well. It feels weird to say, but I admire its ability to thoroughly explore topics like gang violence, drug addiction, domestic abuse, and child death while also maintaining a sense of enjoyment. Every character is likeable and funny, which in a way emphasizes the tragedy of it all. My favorite part of the movie however had to be the editing. This film jumps around in time and perspective frequently, the camera work often feels frantic and discombobulated, but it all adds to the elevated energy of it all. I loved watching this film, and I definitely plan on revisiting it in the future.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Day 2: Spain</h2>
                
                <div class="film-card">
                    <img src="The Spirit of the Beehive.jpg" alt="The Last Migration poster" class="film-card-image">
                    <div class="film-card-content">
                        <h3 class="film-card-title">The Spirit of the Beehive</h3>
                        <div class="film-card-director">Director: Alejandro Morales</div>
                        <p>The second film of the festival was <i>The Spirit of the Beehive</i> <i>(El Espiritu de La Colmena)</i>, a Spanish film that takes place soon after the end of the Spanish Civil War and follows two sisters who seek out their imaginary friend in the real world after watching the movie Frankenstein for the first time. This is a very slow, quiet film with extensive long shots of mundane activities occurring in the beautiful Spanish countryside. And while yes, it is gorgeous scenery, I didn’t find that any of it amounted to anything. Had I gone into the film with a better understanding of the cultural or historical significance of the film, I might have enjoyed it more. Sadly, that was not the case. I spent the majority of this movie’s short runtime either bored or confused.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h2>Day 3: China</h2>
                
                <div class="film-card">
                    <img src="House of the Flying Daggers.jpg" alt="House of the Flying Daggers Poster" class="film-card-image">
                    <div class="film-card-content">
                        <h3 class="film-card-title">House of the Flying Daggers</h3>
                        <div class="film-card-director">Director: Zhang Yimou</div>
                        <p>The third and final day of the film festival was the one I was most excited for. On this day, the Lyric Theater showed <i>House of the Flying Daggers</i> <i>(十面埋伏)</i>. I’ve enjoyed watching martial arts movies like <i>Enter the Dragon</i>, <i>The Karate Kid</i>, and <i>Kill Bill</i> in the past, so I had high expectations. Watching this film was a lot of fun. It takes place during the Tang Dynasty where the police force is attempting to take down a rebel organization known as the House of the Flying Daggers. I was immediately struck by the colors. The effort put into the sets and costumes is clear—each piece is immaculate. The choreography of the fight scenes was ornate and implausible, sure, but very entertaining. There were a few parts of the film that I didn’t enjoy: I didn’t find the romance plotline believable, and I think the writers tried to cram too many plot twists into the final act of the movie. Still, I found this to be a tremendously enjoyable watch, and a great conclusion to the film festival.

                <h2></h2>
                
                <p>After seeing these three films, I feel even <i>more</i> excited about watching international cinema. The fact that a small independent movie theater like the Lyric holds an event like this every year is a luxury, and one I think more people in our area should take advantage of. To the readers that may feel adverse to watching iternational cinema because it seems like there is a barrier to entry, I'd like to assure you now that there is not. Watch international cinema. Go see what special movies your local theater is showing. You might just find something that you love.</p>
